## Computing

There exist a plethora of methods of computation. The most commonly used computation is classical computation. Others include 
### Classical Computing

Also known as binary computing, classical computing is a system of computation that uses bits (represented by 0 and 1) to logically store and manipulate information. Historically, all computers from Babbage's theoretical "analytical machine" to the supercomputers produced by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's subsidiary, Cray Inc., have operated according to classical computing [1]. Classical computers have overcome massive computation feats, made increasingly possible by small and faster transitors. Consequently, we seek to solve harder problems that require greater amounts of computing power. But soon this won't be possible to achieve with classical computers. Moore's Law is becoming less of a reality[2],  and when we are no longer able to reduce the size of transitors, we must look beyond classical computers for new ways of solving increasingly complex problems.

### Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a system of computation that uses qubits (represented by 0, 1, or both in a phenenma called superposition) to store and manipulate information. Instead of relying on classical mechanics, this system is based on quantum mechanics, where each qubit is a spin. If we consider qubits as vectors, then 0 ("spin up") and 1 ("spin down") are the two possible basis states that can be represented as |0> and |1>.
