### Classical Computing

Also known as binary computing, classical computing is a system of computation that uses bits (represented by 0 and 1) to logically store and manipulate information. Historically, all computers from Babbage's theoretical "analytical machine" to the supercomputers produced by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's subsidiary, Cray Inc., have operated according to classical computing [1].
